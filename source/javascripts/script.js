// Below is an example of how to import a javascript file,
// that will be concatenated and uglified by guard and sprockets.
// To use the require statement above the hash/pound to the
// left of the keyword "require" needs to be removed.

//= require "jQuery/index.js"
//= #require "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js"
//= #require "flexslider/jquery.flexslider.js"
